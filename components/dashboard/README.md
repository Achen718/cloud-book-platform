### 1. README for Dashboard Components

### General: 
- The sidebar component was from a component library (material tailwind). This is general sidebar menu that includes Next.js Link Components with each list item. The data is hardcoded, instead of receiving props to be flexible. This was inteded to be setup as a dashboard menu

### How to use:
- The component itself is plug-n-play UI component. Each link and List item must be manually updated if any data needs to be changed.

### Interactions:
- Mainly used for routing purposes. 

### My Throught process:
- Fastest way to create UI then adding logic to it
