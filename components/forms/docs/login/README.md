### README for LoginForm Component

### General: 
- This component handles user login functionality.

### How to use:
- The component itself is a plug-n-play UI component. It includes the form for user login.

### Example
```
import LoginForm from '@/components/forms/Login';

const Login = () => {
  return (
    <section>
      <LoginForm />
    </section>
  );
};

export default Login;
```

export default MyApp;
### Interactions:
- **Component Interactions**: 
  - The LoginForm component interacts with the authentication API to handle user login.
- **State Management**: 
  - The component uses local state to manage form inputs and error messages.
- **Event Handling**: 
  - The component handles user actions such as submitting the login form. These actions trigger state updates and API calls.
- **API Interactions**: 
  - The component sends API requests to authenticate the user when the form is submitted.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: 
  - The component does not use any specific lifecycle methods.


### My Throught process:
- Using the Component library Form to create a simple login form that interacts with the authentication API to log in users.
